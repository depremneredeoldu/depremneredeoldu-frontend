# DepremNeredeOldu: Frontend

For this project, we used Vanilla JS on the frontend. The goal is to visualize the earthquakes in Turkey on map with [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com). The data comes from our API backend that you can take a look in [depremneredeoldu-backend](https://github.com/depremneredeoldu/depremneredeoldu-backend) repository.

## Install

    git clone https://github.com/depremneredeoldu/depremneredeoldu-frontend.git

## Before to test

You have to change the <u>access token</u> to use **MapBox** in the config file in **assets/js/configMap.js**

To do that, you just need to sign up on [MapBox](https://mapbox.com).

## Data
